# Test Driven Development

## Purpose
RED-GREEN-REFACTOR enforcement.

## Auto-Trigger
- When starting a new feature or module.
- When fixing a bug.
- When the user asks for TDD.

## Process
1.  **Red**: Write a failing test for the new functionality.
2.  **Green**: Write just enough code to pass the test.
3.  **Refactor**: Improve the code without changing behavior.
4.  **Repeat**: Move to the next test.

## Anti-Patterns
- Writing code before tests.
- Writing too much code for one test.
- Skipping refactoring.
