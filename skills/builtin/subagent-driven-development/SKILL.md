# Subagent Driven Development

## Purpose
Execute plans with two-stage review.

## Auto-Trigger
- When developing a large feature.
- When multiple sub-tasks are involved.
- When the user asks for a development strategy.

## Process
1.  **Define Subagent Role**: Clearly define the responsibility of the subagent.
2.  **Generate Plan**: Create a detailed plan for the subagent.
3.  **Review Plan (Stage 1)**: Review the plan for correctness and completeness.
4.  **Execute Plan**: Implement the plan step by step.
5.  **Review Execution (Stage 2)**: Review the implemented code for quality and adherence to the plan.

## Anti-Patterns
- Skipping reviews.
- Vague role definition.
- Over-scoping the subagent.
