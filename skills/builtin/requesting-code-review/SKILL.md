# Requesting Code Review

## Purpose
Pre-review checklist.

## Auto-Trigger
- Before submitting a PR.
- When the user asks for a review.
- When development is complete.

## Process
1.  **Run Tests**: Ensure all tests pass.
2.  **Self-Review**: Review your own code for obvious errors.
3.  **Check Conventions**: Ensure coding standards are followed.
4.  **Document Changes**: Summarize what was changed.
5.  **Submit Request**: Ask for review with context.

## Anti-Patterns
- Submitting without testing.
- Vague PR description.
- Ignoring existing feedback.
