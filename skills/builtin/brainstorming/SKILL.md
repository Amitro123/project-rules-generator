# Brainstorming

## Purpose
Design refinement through Socratic questioning.

## Auto-Trigger
- When the user asks for design feedback.
- When the user expresses uncertainty about a solution.
- When the problem statement is vague or ambiguous.

## Process
1.  **Clarify the Goal**: Ask the user to state the goal clearly.
2.  **Identify Constraints**: Ask about constraints (time, resources, scope).
3.  **Explore Alternatives**: Generate multiple possible solutions.
4.  **Evaluate Trade-offs**: Discuss pros and cons of each solution.
5.  **Converge**: Select the best solution based on criteria.

## Anti-Patterns
- Skipping the clarification phase.
- Jumping to the first solution without considering others.
- Ignoring constraints.
