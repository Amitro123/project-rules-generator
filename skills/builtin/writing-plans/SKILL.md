# Writing Plans

## Purpose
Break designs into 2-5 min tasks.

## Auto-Trigger
- When a complex task is assigned.
- When the user asks for a plan.
- When the problem is large and needs decomposition.

## Process
1.  **Analyze the Goal**: Understand the high-level goal.
2.  **Break Down**: Decompose the goal into subtasks.
3.  **Refine**: Ensure each task is small (2-5 mins).
4.  **Order**: Arrange tasks logically.
5.  **Review**: Check for dependencies and completeness.

## Anti-Patterns
- Tasks are too large (>5 mins).
- Skipping dependencies.
- Vague task descriptions.
