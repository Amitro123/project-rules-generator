## CONTEXT

A demo project for testing the rules generator. This shows basic functionality.

This project uses: python, fastapi, docker

## DO (must follow)

- Use python, fastapi, docker as the primary tech stack
- Add type hints and docstrings to all public functions
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Follow existing project structure and naming conventions
- Document breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md or release notes
- Run linters/formatters before committing (black, ruff, eslint, etc.)
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
- Review your own code before requesting review from others

## DON'T

- Don't commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to version control
- Don't use global variables without explicit justification
- Don't bypass linting rules without documenting why
- Don't modify core infrastructure without team discussion
- Don't leave commented-out code without explaining why
- Don't add dependencies without checking license compatibility

## PRIORITIES

1. **Fast Processing** - Handles 10,000+ files per minute
2. **Multiple Formats** - JSON, CSV, Markdown output
3. **Flexible Config**
