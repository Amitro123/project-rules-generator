# Skill: Brainstorming & Design Refinement

## Purpose
Refine vague ideas into concrete, implementable designs through Socratic questioning.

## Auto-Trigger
- User says: "I want to add...", "Let's build...", "I'm thinking about..."
- Before any code is written
- When requirements are unclear

## Process

### Stage 1: Clarify the Goal
Ask:
1. What problem are you trying to solve?
2. Who is the user/consumer of this feature?
3. What does success look like?

### Stage 2: Explore Alternatives
Present 2-3 approaches with trade-offs:
- Simplest solution
- Most robust solution
- Hybrid approach

### Stage 3: Define Scope
Break down into:
- Must have (MVP)
- Nice to have
- Out of scope (for now)

### Stage 4: Present Design
Show design in digestible chunks (max 10 lines per section):
- Data models
- API contracts
- Key algorithms
- Edge cases

### Stage 5: Get Sign-Off
Wait for explicit approval before proceeding.

## Output
Create `DESIGN.md` with:
- Problem statement
- Chosen approach
- Implementation outline
- Success criteria

## Anti-Patterns
❌ Jumping to implementation without design
❌ Overwhelming user with too much info at once
❌ Not exploring alternatives
❌ Missing edge cases
