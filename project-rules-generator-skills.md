## PROJECT CONTEXT
- **Type**: Ml Pipeline
- **Tech Stack**: python, fastapi, react
- **Domain**: ![Python 3.11+](https://python.org)...

## CORE SKILLS

### analyze-code
Parse and analyze codebase for quality issues.

**Tools:** read, search, exec

**Usage:**
```bash
analyze-code src/
```
Output: Quality report with suggestions

### refactor-module
Refactor following project rules.

**Input:** Module path
**Output:** Refactored code + diff

### test-coverage
Run tests and generate coverage.

**Tools:** exec pytest

**Usage:**
```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term
```

## TECH SPECIFIC SKILLS

### fastapi-security-auditor
Check FastAPI endpoints for common security issues.

**When to use:**
- Adding new authenticated endpoints
- Reviewing dependency injection
- Pydantic model validation

### react-expert
Analyze and refactor React components using best practices.

**When to use:**
- Complex state management logic
- Performance optimization (memoization)
- Component reusability analysis

**Checks:**
- Hook dependency arrays
- Prop drilling issues
- Component composition

## ML PIPELINE SKILLS

### model-performance-analyzer
Analyze model metrics and suggest improvements.

**When to use:**
- Training plateaus
- Inference too slow
- Poor generalization

### data-pipeline-optimizer
Optimize data loading and preprocessing.

**When to use:**
- Training bottlenecked by data
- Memory issues

**Output:** Profiling report + optimization suggestions

### video-processing-optimizer
Analyze and optimize video processing pipelines.

**When to use:**
- Slow frame extraction
- High memory usage during processing
- Batch processing bottlenecks

**Checks:**
- ffmpeg parameters (codec, quality, threading)
- Frame sampling strategy
- Parallel processing opportunities

**Tools:** ffmpeg, profiler

### broadcast-segmentation-analyzer
Evaluate scene segmentation quality.

**When to use:**
- Segments too short/long
- Missing scene boundaries
- False positive splits

**Metrics:** 
- Boundary precision/recall
- Segment duration distribution
- Visual/audio change correlation

### embedding-quality-tester
Test and compare embedding models for search.

**When to use:**
- Evaluating new embedding models
- Search quality issues
- Need domain-specific embeddings

**Output:** Comparison report + recommendations

## ADDITIONAL: AGENT

### agent-workflow-analyzer
Analyze agent orchestration patterns and bottlenecks.

**When to use:**
- Complex multi-agent workflows
- Performance bottlenecks
- Debugging agent loops

**Tools:** read, exec, trace
